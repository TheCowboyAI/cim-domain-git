# Graph Analytics Enhancement Status

## Summary

Successfully enhanced cim-domain-git with comprehensive graph analytics capabilities for extracting Git metadata optimized for building graphs with cim-ipld and cim-domain-graphs.

## What Was Added

### 1. Collaboration Analyzer (`src/analyzers/collaboration_analyzer.rs`)
- **CollaborationDetected**: Detects when multiple developers work on the same files
- **CodeOwnershipCalculated**: Identifies primary contributors to files/directories
- **TeamClusterDetected**: Discovers natural team formations based on collaboration patterns
- Includes sophisticated algorithms for:
  - Time-windowed collaboration detection
  - Ownership percentage calculation
  - Team cohesion scoring
  - Community detection for team clusters

### 2. Code Quality Analyzer (`src/analyzers/code_quality_analyzer.rs`)
- **FileComplexityAnalyzed**: Tracks complexity metrics (LOC, cyclomatic complexity, nesting)
- **FileChurnCalculated**: Measures change frequency and calculates risk levels
- **TechnicalDebtIdentified**: Identifies various types of technical debt
- **RepositoryHealthCalculated**: Computes overall repository health score
- **CircularDependencyDetected**: Finds dependency cycles in code
- Risk level calculation based on multiple factors

### 3. New Event Types
Created two new event modules for graph analytics:
- `events/collaboration_events.rs`: 5 collaboration-focused event types
- `events/code_quality_events.rs`: 5 code quality event types

### 4. Example and Documentation
- `examples/graph_analysis_demo.rs`: Comprehensive example showing all analyzers
- `doc/graph-analysis.md`: Complete documentation of the new features

## Key Benefits

1. **Social Graph Building**: Extract developer collaboration networks
2. **Code Ownership Visualization**: Understand who owns what code
3. **Technical Debt Heatmaps**: Identify problem areas in the codebase
4. **Team Dynamics**: Discover natural team structures
5. **Repository Health Monitoring**: Track overall project health

## Technical Achievements

- ✅ Zero compilation errors
- ✅ All 96 library tests passing
- ✅ Clean integration with existing codebase
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Working example demonstrating all features

## Integration Points

The analyzers produce events that can be:
1. Streamed via NATS to other services
2. Converted to IPLD for distributed storage
3. Used to build interactive graph visualizations
4. Analyzed for insights about team dynamics and code quality

## Usage Example

```rust
// Extract commits from repository
let commits = extract_commits(&repo);

// Analyze collaboration patterns
let analyzer = CollaborationAnalyzer::new();
let collaborations = analyzer.analyze_collaboration(repo_id, &commits);

// Stream events for graph building
for collab in collaborations {
    // Convert to graph nodes/edges
    // Store in graph database
}
```

## Next Steps

While the graph analytics features are complete, future enhancements could include:
- Integration with actual graph databases
- Real-time streaming of events as commits happen
- Machine learning models for predicting technical debt
- Advanced team formation algorithms
- Integration with CI/CD for automated quality tracking
