# Git Domain Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

### 1.1 Command Handlers
- [ ] Implement `CloneRepositoryHandler`
  - Use git2-rs for cloning operations
  - Handle authentication (SSH, HTTPS)
  - Support shallow clones
  - Generate `RepositoryCloned` event

- [ ] Implement `FetchRemoteHandler`
  - Fetch updates from remote
  - Handle multiple remotes
  - Generate appropriate events

### 1.2 Basic Projections
- [ ] `RepositoryListProjection`
  - Track all known repositories
  - Store metadata and status
  
- [ ] `RepositoryDetailsProjection`
  - Detailed repository information
  - Branch and tag lists
  - Basic statistics

### 1.3 Query Handlers
- [ ] `GetRepositoryList`
- [ ] `GetRepositoryDetails`
- [ ] `GetBranchList`

## Phase 2: Commit Analysis (Week 2)

### 2.1 Commit Processing
- [ ] Implement `AnalyzeCommitHandler`
  - Extract commit metadata
  - Parse commit messages
  - Track file changes
  - Generate `CommitAnalyzed` events

- [ ] Implement commit traversal
  - Walk commit history
  - Handle merge commits
  - Support date ranges

### 2.2 Commit Projections
- [ ] `CommitHistoryProjection`
  - Store commit metadata
  - Track parent-child relationships
  
- [ ] `FileChangeProjection`
  - Track file modifications
  - Calculate change statistics

## Phase 3: Graph Integration (Week 3)

### 3.1 Graph Extraction
- [ ] Implement `ExtractCommitGraphHandler`
  - Convert commits to graph nodes
  - Create edges for parent-child relationships
  - Handle branch points and merges
  - Generate `CommitGraphExtracted` event

- [ ] Integrate with cim-domain-graph
  - Create graph aggregates
  - Map Git concepts to graph concepts
  - Preserve metadata

### 3.2 Dependency Analysis
- [ ] Implement basic dependency detection
  - Parse import statements
  - Track file relationships
  - Support multiple languages

## Phase 4: GitHub Integration (Week 4)

### 4.1 MCP Integration
- [ ] Create GitHub MCP adapter
  - Handle authentication
  - Map MCP operations to commands
  
- [ ] Implement GitHub-specific commands
  - `SyncGitHubRepository`
  - `FetchGitHubMetadata`
  - `ImportGitHubIssues`

### 4.2 Enhanced Features
- [ ] Pull request analysis
- [ ] Issue tracking integration
- [ ] Workflow extraction

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Value object validation tests
- [ ] Aggregate behavior tests
- [ ] Command validation tests
- [ ] Event serialization tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Git operations with test repositories
- [ ] Graph extraction verification
- [ ] End-to-end command processing

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Large repository handling
- [ ] Incremental analysis efficiency
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

## Technical Debt Items

1. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error types
   - Recovery strategies
   - User-friendly messages

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching layer
   - Optimize graph generation
   - Stream large datasets

3. **Security**
   - Credential management
   - Input sanitization
   - Access control

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- `git2`: Core Git operations
- `gix`: Advanced Git features (when build issues resolved)
- `tokio`: Async runtime
- `serde`: Serialization

### Internal Dependencies
- `cim-domain`: Core domain types
- `cim-domain-graph`: Graph integration
- `cim-domain-document`: Document processing
- `cim-domain-agent`: MCP integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Large Repository Performance**
   - Mitigation: Implement streaming and pagination
   - Fallback: Shallow clones and incremental processing

2. **Complex Git Histories**
   - Mitigation: Robust merge handling
   - Fallback: Simplified graph representation

3. **GitHub API Limits**
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting and caching
   - Fallback: Batch operations

### Integration Risks
1. **Graph Domain Changes**
   - Mitigation: Abstract integration layer
   - Fallback: Version-specific adapters

2. **MCP Protocol Updates**
   - Mitigation: Flexible command mapping
   - Fallback: Direct API integration

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Successfully clone and analyze repositories
   - Generate accurate commit graphs
   - Extract meaningful dependency information

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Process medium repos (<10k commits) in <30s
   - Handle large repos (>100k commits) gracefully
   - Memory usage <1GB for typical operations

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - Seamless graph domain integration
   - Working GitHub MCP connection
   - Event-driven architecture compliance

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Core infrastructure and basic operations
- **Week 2**: Commit analysis and history tracking
- **Week 3**: Graph extraction and integration
- **Week 4**: GitHub integration and advanced features
- **Week 5**: Testing, optimization, and documentation

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with git2
2. Create test repositories for development
3. Implement first command handler
4. Set up continuous integration
